## pdfwordcounter

[pdfwordcounter](https://github.com/ezgranet/pdfwordcounter/edit/master/index.md) is a very minimal Mac GUI for counting words in a PDF.  It's useful for all those situations where word counts are needed, and not easily obtainable from PDF files.

The app is essentially a wrapper for [poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/), making use of its `pdftotext.
